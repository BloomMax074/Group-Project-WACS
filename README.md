# Group-Project-WACS
Project of group 3 (Wifi Attendance Checking System)
- "There is a need for an efficient and reliable system to track student attendance in educational institutions. The current methods, such as manual sign-in sheets or roll calls, are prone to errors, time-consuming, and easy to cheat. A system based on Wi-Fi that uses MAC address and IP address to track attendance is needed to overcome these issues and provide an accurate record of student attendance."
